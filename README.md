## About Dev Environment:

1. We are transpiling using Babel
2. We are bundling using Webpack
3. we analysing code for errors using ESlint
4. Serving the app using Webpack built in webserver
5. References to css in index.html are done using Webpack
6. Automatically loading changes when on saving files using Webpack
7. We are tying all of these together with npm scripts.
